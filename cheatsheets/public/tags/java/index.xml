      <description>Key resources Compose and testing expressions: https://regex101.com/ Regex number range generator: Regex Numeric Range Generator — Regex Tools — 3Widgets Shorthands for regex There are several pre-defined shorthands for the commonly used character sets:
\d is any digit, short for [0-9] \s is a whitespace character (including tab and newline), short for [ \t\n\x0B\f\r] \w is an alphanumeric character (word), short for [a-zA-Z_0-9] \b is a word boundary A word boundary doesn&amp;rsquo;t match any specific character, it rather matches a boundary between an alphanumeric character and a non-alphanumeric character - for example, a whitespace character - or a boundary of the string (the end or the start of it) - examples: \ba matches any sequence of alphanumeric characters that starts with &amp;ldquo;a&amp;rdquo;, a\b matches any sequence of alphanumeric characters that ends with &amp;ldquo;a&amp;rdquo; \ba\b matches a separate &amp;ldquo;a&amp;rdquo; preceded and followed by non-alphanumeric characters There are also counterparts of these shorthands that are equivalent to the restrictive sets, and match everything except for the characters mentioned above:</description>
